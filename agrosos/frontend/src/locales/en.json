  "growing_garlic_in_pots_description": "Growing garlic in pots is an excellent way to enjoy a fresh and healthy harvest, even in small spaces. Here are the essential steps for successful cultivation:",
  "selection_of_variety_and_pot": "1. Choosing the Variety and Pot",
  "choose_garlic_variety_and_pot_description": "Choose between hardneck garlic, ideal for cold climates and known for its strong flavor, or softneck garlic, better suited for warm climates and easier to store. The pot should be at least 20-30 cm deep and have drainage holes at the bottom to prevent water from accumulating and damaging the roots.",
  "preparation_of_substrate": "2. Preparing the Soil",

  "harvest": "6. Harvesting",
  "garlic_harvest_timing_and_process": "Garlic is usually ready to harvest 8 to 9 months after planting, when the leaves begin to turn yellow and dry out. To harvest, loosen the soil around the bulbs and carefully lift each one. Allow them to dry in a cool, well-ventilated place for a few days before storing.",
