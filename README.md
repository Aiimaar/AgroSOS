## üìñ About The Project

AgroSOS is designed to enhance agricultural productivity by managing data collected from sensors placed on agricultural fields. The system enables farmers, technicians, and administrators to collaborate effectively, using technology to monitor and optimize crop yields.

### Key Features

- üìä **Data Visualization**: Graphs showcasing key indicators of crop health and field conditions.
- ü§ñ **Automation**: Recommendations and actions based on sensor data to optimize crop performance.

### üîê Authentication and Roles

AgroSOS implements both basic and token-based authentication to ensure secure access. The roles used in the system are as follows:

- **Admin**: Manages users and configurations.
- **Farmers**: Registers and manages fields, sensors, and crops, while accessing their specific data.
- **Technicians**: Configures automated rules based on sensor data.

This structure emphasizes the distinction between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (assigning permissions). For example, access to certain frontend routes is restricted based on authentication state, verified by checking tokens stored locally.

## üîÑ Database Queries

This section includes the queries and database setup for the project.

### Database Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have the MySQL database set up correctly. You can use the following steps to configure the database:

1. **Create the database**:

   Log into MySQL and create the database for the project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE agrosos;
   ```
2. Query with the basic structure of the database.

```sql
   Query con la base de datos
   ```
---

### üìë Data Access and Relationships

AgroSOS ensures consistency between the database schema and its relationships through:
 1. A relationship diagram between entities.
    
 2. CRUD operations for more than two related entities.

Data filtering is performed in the backend to optimize performance and ensure data integrity.

## üöÄ How To Get Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aiimaar/AgroSOS.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AgroSOS/agrosos
   ```
3. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   ```
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   cd backend && node express.js
   ```
5. Run the frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

### üñ•Ô∏è RESTful API and CRUD Operations

The project adheres to RESTful principles for communication between frontend and backend. Examples of implemented CRUD operations include:

- **Fields API**:  
  - `GET /api/fields`: Retrieves all fields.  
  - `POST /api/fields`: Creates a new field.  
  - `PUT /api/fields/:id`: Updates a field by ID.  
  - `DELETE /api/fields/:id`: Deletes a field by ID.

API endpoints are documented and tested using Postman. Find the complete collection [here](#postman-link).

### üìÇ Directory Structure

#### Backend
The backend follows a modular structure:
- `routes/`: Contains route definitions for API endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Handles business logic.
- `models/`: Defines database models using Sequelize.

#### Frontend
The frontend maintains separation of concerns:
- `services/`: Houses API interaction logic in isolated modules.

The chosen structure simplifies maintenance and scaling. Compared to a flat structure, this approach enhances readability and minimizes coupling between components.

## üì¶ System Requirements

Make sure to have the following programs installed before getting started:

- **Node.js** (version >=14.x)
- **MySQL** (version >=5.7)
- **NPM** or **Yarn** (for managing dependencies)

### üåê System Design Comparison

The project adopts the **Enfoque 1** architecture, utilizing separate frontend and backend technologies. In contrast, **Enfoque 2** integrates server-side rendering tools like Laravel Blade. The decision to use Enfoque 1 enables:

- Enhanced scalability.
- Clearer separation of concerns.

Technologies:
- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: ReactJS

An example comparison:

| Feature                | Enfoque 1 (AgroSOS)           | Enfoque 2                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Communication          | RESTful APIs                 | Server-side rendering    |
| Technologies           | Node.js, ReactJS             | Laravel Blade            |
| Flexibility            | High                         | Moderate                 |
